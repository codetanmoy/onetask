# OneThing — App Ideology

## What OneThing is
OneThing is a **single-action daily focus app**:
- Set **one task** for today
- Run **one timer**
- Mark **done**
- Review a small history for sanity

It’s designed to reduce choice, not create more.

## What OneThing is NOT
These are explicitly out of scope for MVP:
- Task lists / projects / sub-tasks
- Habit tracking / streak pressure
- Focus locking / app blocking / enforcement
- Social features
- “Productivity guilt” dashboards

## Core promise (user-facing)
> “Pick one thing. Do it. Done.”

## Product principles (non-negotiable)
- **One screen first**: Home must be enough for daily usage.
- **Low friction**: one input, one button path.
- **No shame**: history is for reality-check, not scoring.
- **Local-first**: works offline, fast, private.
- **System-native**: feels like iOS, not a web app.

## Success metrics (qualitative)
- User sets the task within **5 seconds**
- Timer usage is obvious and reliable
- Completion feels satisfying (haptic + tiny confirmation)
- History helps users trust themselves (not judge themselves)

## MVP definition
MVP is complete when:
- Today task can be set/edited
- Start/stop timer survives background/app kill
- “Running” state is visible
- Mark done stores timestamp
- Small history exists (7–14 days), auto-purged
